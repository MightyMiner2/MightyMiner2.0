# Mighty Miner Feature Explanation

## Gemstone Macro
Automatically mine the gemstones nearby and pathfind to the next vein

Start it underground in crystal hollows to avoid being attacked by mobs
Make sure to disable mole perk

## Powder Macro
Automatically mines out hardstone and solves the treasure chests

It traces out a curve which mines out the blocks in front of you. 
Remember to turn on centre to block and bring an AOTE/V and disable nuker
You may customise the way it mine using radius and rate in the settings
If you wish to mine using jungle pickaxe, toggle ‘mine using pickaxe’
Use ``blue cheese drill switch`` for higher powder gain

## Mithril Macro
As its name suggests, mines mithril nearby

## AOTV Gemstone Macro 
Mines gemstones with your desired route (set up with waypoints)

## Commission macro
Automatically completes all dwarven mines commissions 1 and 3

## Waypoint GUI
The keybind to open it is in minecraft settings
You may have multiple routes stored. Click "select" to select the route and click "Add new waypoints list" to create a new route (routes are shown as "Waypoint lists") 
Click "Add waypoint" to add your location to the selected route. You may also use the "Add waypoint" keybind
Right click on the on waypoints or routes to change the name/value of them 

Note: The routes are stored in aotv_coords_mm.json.
Convert the old routes to the new routes using the “import routes” button

### Drawings 
You may toggle on "draw blocks blocking vision" so you know which blocks to mine out, to make sure that you can AOTV between the waypoints
Maximum distance between each waypoint is 55 blocks

### Configuration
Choose your camera speed
If the macro mines out cobblestone too often, increase the accuracy checks (If you don't know what it means, just leave it alone or refer to the code) 
Set teleport time threshold so the macro stops if you teleport too often (the veins didn't respawn)

You can turn it on anywhere

### Required items:
- Etherwarp AOTV with +4 tunings
- Juju shortbow / Aurora staff / Terminator
